						The development life cycle
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This site followed the standard development life cycle. The <em>Conceptualization</em> phase produced the basic goals of the site, along with a set of requirements. The presentation of the requirements also incorporated a large portion of the <em>Analysis</em> phase. The student instructions thus produced were the starting point for the developer.</p>
						<p>This website in its current state is lodged firmly in the <em>Design</em> phase: Site organization has been determined, page layout has been developed, and by golly a working prototype, bursting with glorious Lorem Ipsum, coded.</p>
						<p>The next step would be the actual <em>Production</em> of the website. Assuming that the project sponsors 
							like what we've done with the prototype, the stubbed out pages would be fully realized, Lorem Ipsum replaced with actual content, server-side code built and deployed to handle web page submissions. The whole mess would be deployed to a test server for a thorough thrashing, including UAT (User Acceptance Testing) to ensure design requirements were satisfied.</p>
							<p>Following a rigorous regimen of unit and integration testing in the <em>Testing</em> phase, the site would be deployed to production servers and opened up to the interwebs at large.  After the resulting bugs and crashes are dealt with (code, like battle plans,  rarely survives first contact with the enemy), the site would be considered in production and code-stable.</p>
							<p>The last phase would be the <em>Maintenance</em> phase, which will last for the lifetime of the site. The occasional random broken links would be remedied, content would be updated, hosting environment tweaked, and back-end code modified to meet changing business needs.</p>
					</dd>

						Design Principles
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							I started the design of this site with a bit of an internal conflict. One one hand, I wanted to make a professional-looking site with simple, straightforward layout and navigation. On the other hand, a lot of design sites I have visited tend to really emphasize the artsy-fartsy side and favor striking themes and lots of graphical elements. In the end the simple approach won out because I prefer simple to complex and am frankly not yet good enough to convincingly pull off a typical "artsy" website design.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first design choice was the color scheme. The logo has two colors that coexist relatively well, so I started with one of the logo colors (#16667F) as the primary. I used the Split Complementary color scheme to derive the remaining colors of the site. The menu bar at the top is the only structural element that really ties in with the logo color. The heading elements are colored to present a complimentary contrast to the logo and menu bar.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since the logo was simple, and had 2 colors, I added "Zillim" and "Design" on each side, matching text color to the logo colors, and centered the elements on the page. This was to contrast the design with a standard logo-on-the-left approach.
						</p>
						<p>A white content area with few colors provides a professional appearance befitting a serious business. Contrasting color is used for text, albeit softened a bit by using grey for the color. The headers are a strong point becasue of their contrasting color, drawing attention to important parts of each page. </p>
						<p>
							A <em>jello</em> design was chosen for the layout because the pages are pretty simple with few internal divisions. A horizontal menu bar was chosen because it fits well with a jello layout and helps to separate the logo area from the content.
						</p>
						<p>
							The site is arranged in a hierarchical format. This format is appropriate because the content is simple and well-organized.
						</p>
						<img id="hierarchyChart" src="images/Zillim%20Hierarchy.png" alt="Zillim Hierarchy chart" />
						<p>Navigation is accomplished using a simple horizontal menu, appropriate for a 1-level hierarchical site.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>
						Promotion of the site
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>I would try to secure <em>preferred placement</em> on search sites that support it. It would be advantageous to have Zillum show up at the top of searches for web development services, especially since an alphabetic ranking would place Zillum far below its competitors.</p>
						<p>Of course, clever specification of <em>description and keyword meta tags</em> could  probably help Zillum feature prominently on web search results.</p>
						<p>I would try <em>Banner ads</em> targeted towards websites that provide Web Design services, on the theory that people who are pursuing web design services might be interested in a company to perform the next step, e.g. developing the site. If these did not pan out I probably wouldn't keep paying for them, however.'</p>
						<p><em>Sticky Site Features</em> with topical information tend to keep my attention a lot longer than a static site where nothing new is going on.</p>
						<p>When someone volunteers their email address, a <em>Newsletter</em> is a great way to keep in touch and let them know about new services or products.</p>
						<p>Let's not forget about <em>Social Media</em> like Facebook and Twitter.  It seems <span class="italic">de rigeur</span> nowadays to plaster yourself all over these social sites, so I guess that any company that does not do so is missing out.  But then how many companies actually get business because they are on Twitter? </p>
						<p>Apparently having a <em>Blog</em> is the cool thing for companies.  It does provide a place where the company can present itself in what might be perceived as a more informal manner (as opposed to an advertisement, for example). Zillum could blog about topical subjects while gently promoting their services.</p>
